# student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## How to use

To execute the basic application:
```
ruby directory.rb 
```

To execute the  fully functional application:
```
ruby directory2.rb file.csv
```
where `file.csv` is a csv file of students to load for the application to manage

## Other files
`question_11.rb` was provided as a file full of typos and other mistakes. The learning exercise was to correct those whilst viewing the file in plain text format. The corrected version in this repo will closely match `directory.rb`
